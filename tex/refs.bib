                 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories
                 in the history of life on Earth. From their first appearance in
                 the Early Cretaceous, ants have come to occupy keystone
                 positions in virtually all major terrestrial habitats, and they
                 are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or
                 remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated,
                 our understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and
                 ecology is far from complete. It is estimated that only half of
                 the world's ant species - currently numbering about 12,200 -
                 have been described. AntWeb's [www.antweb.org] mission is to
                 develop tools to accelerate the discovery and documentation of
                 ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely accessible
                 across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's
                 largest online database of images, specimen records, and
                 natural history information on ants. A standardized digitizing
                 protocol has been set up for extant species, which optimizes
                 the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal, profile, and
                 head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when
                 applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000
                 high quality images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010
                 extant species. But the picture would be incomplete without the
                 fossils. Recently the world catalogue of the fossil ants was
                 added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each
                 represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in
                 various fossil collections throughout the world. Besides the
                 difficulty to access some of them, the main limitation to
                 digitizing fossil ants is their mode of preservation. From
                 spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and
                 showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the
                 often shadowy outlines hinting at a structure that seems just
                 out of view provided by an imprint, fossil ants often cannot be
                 imaged following all the standards of extant specimens, and
                 instead require specific methods for high quality image
                 acquisition.},

                descriptor for plant species identification based on bark
                texture images. Termed Statistical Macro Binary Pattern (SMBP),
                the descriptor is informative, rotation invariant, and it is
                designed to encode texture information from a large support
                area. The main novelty of this approach is the use of
                statistical description to represent the intensity distribution
                in the large support area, and an LBP-like encoding scheme to
                derive a statistical macro pattern by thresholding it against
                its adaptive statistical prototype. We propose to test three
                neighborhood sampling schemes according to the angular
                quantization at each level of the macrostructure. The
                comprehensive experiments on three challenging bark datasets

  abstract = {Summary
              Insects comprise over half of all described animal species.
              Together with the Protura (coneheads), Collembola (springtails)
              and Diplura (two-pronged bristletails), insects form the Hexapoda,
              a terrestrial arthropod lineage characterised by possessing six
              legs. Exponential growth of genome-scale data for the hexapods has
              substantially altered our understanding of the origin and
              evolution of insect biodiversity. Phylogenomics has provided a new
              framework for reconstructing insect evolutionary history,
              resolving their position among the arthropods and some
              long-standing internal controversies such as the placement of the
              termites, twisted-winged insects, lice and fleas. However, despite
              the greatly increased size of phylogenomic datasets, contentious
              relationships among key insect clades remain unresolved. Further
              advances in insect phylogeny cannot rely on increased depth and
              breadth of genome and taxon sequencing. Improved modelling of the
              substitution process is fundamental to countering
              tree-reconstruction artefacts, while gene content, modelling of
              duplications and deletions, and comparative morphology all provide
              complementary lines of evidence to test hypotheses emerging from
              the analysis of sequence data. Finally, the integration of
              molecular and morphological data is key to the incorporation of
              fossil species within insect phylogeny. The emerging integrated
              framework of insect evolution will help explain the origins of
              insect megadiversity in terms of the evolution of their body plan,
              species diversity and ecology. Future studies of insect phylogeny
              should build upon an experimental, hypothesis-driven approach
              where the robustness of hypotheses generated is tested against
              increasingly realistic evolutionary models as well as
              complementary sources of phylogenetic evidence.}

                more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve,
                organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such
                data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce
                here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built
                upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the
                majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean
                and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated
                images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a
                detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247
                synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger
                in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets.
                Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe
                the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate
                the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object
                recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope
                that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can
                offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision

              Classification of insect species is is a particularly difficult challenge
              because of the high degree of similarity of the appearance between distinct
              species. Given the visual commonalities across different levels of taxonomic
              hierarchies (i.e. class, order, family, etc.), insect classifcation provides
