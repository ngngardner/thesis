                 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories
                 in the history of life on Earth. From their first appearance in
                 the Early Cretaceous, ants have come to occupy keystone
                 positions in virtually all major terrestrial habitats, and they
                 are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or
                 remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated,
                 our understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and
                 ecology is far from complete. It is estimated that only half of
                 the world's ant species - currently numbering about 12,200 -
                 have been described. AntWeb's [www.antweb.org] mission is to
                 develop tools to accelerate the discovery and documentation of
                 ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely accessible
                 across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's
                 largest online database of images, specimen records, and
                 natural history information on ants. A standardized digitizing
                 protocol has been set up for extant species, which optimizes
                 the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal, profile, and
                 head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when
                 applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000
                 high quality images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010
                 extant species. But the picture would be incomplete without the
                 fossils. Recently the world catalogue of the fossil ants was
                 added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each
                 represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in
                 various fossil collections throughout the world. Besides the
                 difficulty to access some of them, the main limitation to
                 digitizing fossil ants is their mode of preservation. From
                 spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and
                 showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the
                 often shadowy outlines hinting at a structure that seems just
                 out of view provided by an imprint, fossil ants often cannot be
                 imaged following all the standards of extant specimens, and
                 instead require specific methods for high quality image
                 acquisition.},

                descriptor for plant species identification based on bark texture images.
                Termed Statistical Macro Binary Pattern (SMBP), the descriptor is informative,
                rotation invariant, and it is designed to encode texture information from a
                large support area. The main novelty of this approach is the use of
                statistical description to represent the intensity distribution in the large
                support area, and an LBP-like encoding scheme to derive a statistical macro
                pattern by thresholding it against its adaptive statistical prototype. We
                propose to test three neighborhood sampling schemes according to the angular
                quantization at each level of the macrostructure. The comprehensive
                experiments on three challenging bark datasets (BarkTex, Trunk12, AFF) show
                that our descriptor achieves high and more consistent identification rates
                when compared with LBP-like texture descriptors.},
