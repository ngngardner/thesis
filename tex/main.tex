\noindent There is a large variety of ant species, and most species are diverse
in terms of size, shape, behaviors, and especially skin (cuticle) textures.
However, the significance of ant cuticle texture is not widely researched. This
research employs modern machine learning methods such as texture analysis and
classification with CNN and clustering to automatically group similar ant
species to allow for the study of influences cuticle texture on ant ecology.

\section{CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND}
\subsection{Introduction}

Insects comprise over half of the world's animal biodiversity
\cite{tihelka_evolution_2021}. Insects are vital to many ecosystem functions,
including nutrient recycling, plant propagation, and maintenance of plant and
animal communities \cite{gullan_insects_2009, berenbaum_bugs_1996}. As technology
advances, systems which can automatically analyze insect-based information are
growing in demand by biologists. Due to the extensive number of insect species,
manual exploration of insect-based information is difficult and often requires
specialized expertise. Therefore, automated entomology is gaining attraction by
both biologists and computer scientists and is expected to be a major
contribution to the future of insect-based research
\cite{martineau_survey_2017}. One of the most commonly used data types for
insect analysis is image data. To develop an image-based system for insect
analysis, we can take advantage of existing work in general image processing and
texture analysis methods.

Texture is an important feature in many applications, such as image processing,
pattern recognition, and computer vision. Analysis of textures can be broken
into three main categories: texture classification, texture segmentation, and
texture synthesis \cite{reed_review_1993}. The process of classifying a texture
into a set of categories and relies on three different approaches. In this
paper, we focus on a \textit{model-based approach} which attempts to extract
parameters to reveal common patterns and use those parameters to automatically
distinguish between different textures \cite{maillard_texture_2003}.

In this work, we explore automated entomology specifically for ants. Although
there is some work regarding grouping ants into categories of similar cuticle,
automated categorization has yet to become an active area of research. In
general, the goal of automated insect classification methods is species
indentification - \textit{i.e.} the identification of species from a set of
observations. Due to the large number of different ant species, large scale ant
species indentification with standard classification methods is not feasible.
Therefore, we must simplify the problem by either other classifying a certain
subset of ant species or by applying categories to the entire set of ant
species.

In many texture analysis methods, the general goal is to automatically
categorize an object into a set of objects with similar texture-based features.
The approach of texture analysis to categorize similarly texture-based objects
corresponds well to the demands of ant identification. Texture analysis has
shown promising results in related fields, such as plant identification
\cite{boudra_plant_2018}. With modern texture analysis methods, the
categorization of ants can be automated and the results can be used to study the
influence of cuticle texture on ant ecology.

\subsection{Research Question}

The overarching question that we wish to address by beginning this research is:
\textit{how does the texture of ant cuticle affect the ant ecology}? However, to
even begin contemplating this question requires a substantial amount of
preliminiary research. One point that is necessary to begin this research is to
propose a method of group ants by texture. Additionally, due to the sheer number
of ant species, an automated effort is necessary to group similar ant species.
Therefore, we start our endeavor with a more straightforward research question:
\textit{are texture analysis methods able to group similar ant species}? By the
end of this research, we will answer this question by demonstrating a variety of
texture analysis methods and comparing their results on a custom dataset.

\subsection{Proposed Approach}

In order to group similar ant species, we require mostly uniform images that
depict the texture of the ant cuticle. We source our raw images from AntWeb
\cite{perrichot_antweb_2012}, a database of ant head images. An example image is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:CASENT0217419}. In general, the ant head images are centered in
the image, facing the front, and share a similar posture. However, some images
may not be centered, show the ant head in a different orientation, or may have a
drastically different resolution from the average image. With some data
preprocessing methods, these ant head images are suitable for traditional
methods of image classification.

\subsection{Research Impact}

The primary contribution of this research is the development of a unique dataset
for ant cuticle texture classification. Additionally, we compare the results of
state-of-the-art deep learning and texture analysis methods on our proposed
dataset. The secondary contribution is the analysis of the results of these
methods and data analysis.

\subsection{Insect Classification}

In this section, we provide an overview of some insect classification methods.

\citeauthor*{lim_performance_2017} apply a CNN-based algorithm for insect
classification \cite{lim_performance_2017}. \citeauthor*{lim_performance_2017}
classify a subset of insect species and families based on the classes available
in the ImageNet dataset \cite{deng_imagenet_2009}. ImageNet is a widely used
dataset of images labeled by experts with millions of images and thousands of
categories \cite{deng_imagenet_2009}. In the ImageNet dataset, there are some
categories that specify the class of the insect on a species level,
\textit{e.g.} \textit{monarch butterfly} and \textit{ringlet butterfly} as well
as some categories that specify the class of the insect on a family level,
\textit{e.g.} \textit{ant}, \textit{fly}, and \textit{bee}
\cite{imagenet_labels}. \citeauthor*{lim_performance_2017} use a modified
AlexNet architecture and experiment on how different numbers of kernels affect
the performance of the model \cite{lim_performance_2017}.
\citeauthor*{glick_insect_2016} employ a similar approach by classifying 277
insect classes from ImageNet using a hierarchical CNN \cite{glick_insect_2016}.
The results from \citeauthor*{lim_performance_2017} and
\citeauthor*{glick_insect_2016} suggest that a CNN is capable of differentiating
between different hierarchical classes of insects. In our research, we are
interested in the classification of ant images of a hierarchical level
in-between species and family.
